# Abstract controller providing a basic list action.
# The loaded model entries are available in the view as an instance variable
# named after the +model_class+ or by the helper method +entries+.
#
# The +index+ action lists all entries of a certain model and provides
# functionality to search and sort this list.
# Furthermore, it remembers the last search and sort parameters after the
# user returns from a displayed or edited entry.
